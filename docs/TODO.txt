TODO:
* Change all computations to use doubles instead of floats (change *FLOAT* defines accordingly).
* Make database lookups (AC) at initialization time instead of at runtime FOR EACH spectra!
* Rewrite runManager::run() (and all its dependencies) to allocate memory/objects outside of the run loop
  and move initialization code outside of the loop as well. A lot of work though, maybe not worth it given
  the real time spent doing initializations. It would prevent memory fragmentation however.
* Implement support for half-cleaved AA (as in Phenyx)
