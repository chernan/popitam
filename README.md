# Popitam

Popitam is a method designed to characterize peptides with mutations or unexpected post-translational modifications using MS/MS data. 

It was published in : Hernandez P, Gras R, Frey J, Appel RD. Popitam: towards new heuristic strategies to improve protein identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Proteomics. 2003 Jun;3(6):870-8. PubMed PMID: 12833510.

This improved version was made by Florent GlÃ¼ck (github user: florentgluck), and is 1.4 times more efficient than the original software. 
As I used to work on this project at the Proteome Informatics group in Geneva, I (Celine Hernandez) migrated it from Google Code to GitHub for the sake of archiving. But I will not make any new development nor will I perform any maintenance/support on the tool.
